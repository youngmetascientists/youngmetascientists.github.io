          For the first event of 2025, we organized an online meeting during lunch time (12:00 - 14:00) to discuss the 2021 paper by Hoekstra and Vazire, Aspiring to greater intellectual humility in science. We had exciting conversations about what intellectual humility is and should be, its benefits and side effects, and who should be responsible for improving it.

            The most recent PYMS meeting was organized as a precursor to the Dutch Reproducibility Network Symposium. 
            We get to hear amazing work of metascientists from broad range of backgrounds psychological science, computational sciences, sports and exercise science, and nanobioscience. We also had the opportunity of having Tracey Weissgerber as a keynote speaker to talk about having a career in meta-science.
