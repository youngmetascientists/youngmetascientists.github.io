          For the first event of 2025, we organized an online meeting during lunch time (12:00 - 14:00) to discuss the 2021 paper by Hoekstra and Vazire, Aspiring to greater intellectual humility in science. We had exciting conversations about what intellectual humility is and should be, its benefits and side effects, and who should be responsible for improving it.
